		<h2>Metal Gear Solid<h2>
		<p class="paragraph">The story is set in 2005, six years after the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The American Spec-Ops group FOXHOUND 
		has gone rogue and is leading an armed rebellion on a remote island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago. This island, codenamed 
		"Shadow Moses", is the site of a nuclear weapons disposal facility. Led by a mercenary known as Liquid Snake, FOXHOUND has 
		acquired a nuclear-capable mecha, Metal Gear REX, and are threatening to launch a nuclear attack if the U.S. government 
		fails to hand over the remains of the "legendary mercenary" Big Boss, along with a $1 billion ransom, within 24 hours. 
		Solid Snake is forced out of retirement by Colonel Roy Campbell to infiltrate the island and neutralize the enemy threat.</p>
